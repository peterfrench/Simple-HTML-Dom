 * Acknowledge: Jose Solorzano (https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-html/)
 * Contributions by:
 *     Yousuke Kumakura (Attribute filters)
 *     Vadim Voituk (Negative indexes supports of "find" method)
 *     Antcs (Constructor with automatically load contents either text or file/url)
 *
 * all affected sections have comments starting with "PaperG"
 *
 * Paperg - Added case insensitive testing of the value of the selector.
 * Paperg - Added tag_start for the starting index of tags - NOTE: This works but not accurately.
 *  This tag_start gets counted AFTER \r\n have been crushed out, and after the remove_noice calls so it will not reflect the REAL position of the tag in the source,
 *  it will almost always be smaller by some amount.
 *  We use this to determine how far into the file the tag in question is.  This "percentage will never be accurate as the $dom->size is the "real" number of bytes the dom was created from.
 *  but for most purposes, it's a really good estimation.
 * Paperg - Added the forceTagsClosed to the dom constructor.  Forcing tags closed is great for malformed html, but it CAN lead to parsing errors.
 * Allow the user to tell us how much they trust the html.
 * Paperg add the text and plaintext to the selectors for the find syntax.  plaintext implies text in the innertext of a node.  text implies that the tag is a text node.
 * This allows for us to find tags based on the text they contain.
 * Create find_ancestor_tag to see if a tag is - at any level - inside of another specific tag.
 * Paperg: added parse_charset so that we know about the character set of the source document.
 *  NOTE:  If the user's system has a routine called get_last_retrieve_url_contents_content_type availalbe, we will assume it's returning the content-type header from the
 *  last transfer or curl_exec, and we will parse that and use it in preference to any other method of charset detection.
